## Attention
This is under development.  
Our main net is not launched yet.  
As we could reset the blockchain, our token has no value now.  

## Dependence
This program depends on the following libraries.  
- slingshot  
Slingshot is another blockchain project under active development.  
We are using two protocols in the project: zkvm and spacesuit.
